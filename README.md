# indiana-state-fair-food-tracker

This project is a web app for tracking, planning, and rating foods at the Indiana State Fair. It allows users to browse the official "Taste of the Fair" lineup, mark foods they want to try, rate foods they've tasted, and keep notes and stats about their fair food experience.

## Why was this built?

The Indiana State Fair features dozens of unique and creative foods each year, making it hard to remember which ones you want to try or what you thought of them after the fair. This tracker helps fairgoers organize their food adventure, set a budget, and keep a record of their favorites.

## About this project

This project was created as a practice exercise for using AI tools in software development. The code, design, and documentation were generated and refined with the help of AI, making it a learning experience in prompt engineering, code review, and iterative improvement.
